First Cut for the custom web component

It's a plugin to create custom web component of a list of divs on the fly

All one need to do is to call new CustomList Constructor with an Object as param having JSONURL as required property and items if only you want to see n number of items in one go

JSONURL is the required property to indicate from where the data needs to be fetched.

This is a first cut, will be adding build tasks and functionalities like Load More and hide/show of news items
